I'm engineering Privacy and ML features at [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) for 250M+ users and built open-source tools ([MarkUs](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus) & [PythonTA](https://github.com/pyta-uoft/pyta)) used by 10k+ students. Also leading [Blueprint](https://uoftblueprint.org/), [UofT AI](https://www.uoft.ai/). This summer I'm doing quantitative research on a front-office trading desk. Previously won ([Hack the North](https://devpost.com/software/revo), [UofTHacks](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/21736), Google's Toronto Hackathon) and organized Anthropic's Toronto hackathon.

I read a lot of history & geopolitics in my spare time (see [reading list](/books/0_reading_list) and [watchlist](/movies/0_watchlist)). In high school I placed 1st in Ontario and 5th Nationally in debate, coaching many cohorts of students. Previously a competitive swimmer, I'm now a triathlete training for the national age group team, racing a few Ironmans and ultra events this year.
