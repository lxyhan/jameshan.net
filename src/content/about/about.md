I believe the internet is worth fighting for. I work on privacy features at [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) for 250M+ users and build open-source tools ([MarkUs](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus) & [PythonTA](https://github.com/pyta-uoft/pyta)) used by 10k+ students. I run [Blueprint](https://uoftblueprint.org/), [UofT AI](https://www.uoft.ai/), and Anthropic @ UofT. This summer I'm doing quantitative research on a front-office trading desk. Won some hackathons ([Hack the North](https://devpost.com/software/revo), [UofTHacks](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/21736), Google × Hack the Future) and organized others.

I read a lot of history and economics in my spare time. In previous years, I placed 1st in Ontario and 5th Nationally in debate, and coached many cohorts of students.

I'm a triathlete training for the national age group team. Did a few Ironmans and ultra events this year.

Through this blog, I work through ideas that won't leave me alone. If anything resonates, reach out at [jameshan.cs@gmail.com](mailto:jameshan.cs@gmail.com). Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameshan27/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lxyhan).
