OCD is not what you think it is. It's not being neat.

> **What OCD Actually Is**
>
> A disorder that convinces you, with absolute certainty, that you are a monster. Or that the world is about to collapse because of something you did or didn't do.

## What It Actually Is

Your brain generates a horrible thought. Then it whispers:
- *This means something about who you are.*
- *Something terrible will happen if you don't fix this.*

**It finds whatever you care about and attacks it.**

### For Me, It Was Everything

> **Five Manifestations**
>
> **Harm and scrupulosity** — Intrusive thoughts about hurting people I loved. Not urges. I never wanted to. But the thoughts came anyway, and each one felt like evidence. *What kind of person thinks this?*
>
> **Perfectionism** — Checking assignments five, ten, fifteen times. Convinced I'd submitted the wrong file, written my name wrong, made some small mistake that would cascade into catastrophe.
>
> **Contamination** — Worrying my drinks were poisoned. That I'd touched something dangerous. That food I dropped was somehow contaminated but wasting it was also wrong. Trapped between two compulsions.
>
> **Magical thinking** — That not picking something up off the ground would cause something bad to happen. That small mistakes would spiral into disasters through some logic I couldn't articulate but couldn't escape.
>
> **Paranoia** — That everyone could see through me. That they knew what I was thinking.

This wasn't one flavor of anxiety. It was all of them, all the time, rotating through my head in shifts.

## The Trap

OCD thoughts feel real. They feel like revelations about yourself or warnings about the future.

> **The Compulsion Cycle**
>
> So you do what feels logical:
> - Check again
> - Seek reassurance
> - Analyze
> - Avoid

**Every compulsion tells your brain:** *this thought is dangerous. Pay more attention.*

The spiral tightens.

**What I lost:**
- Hours every day
- The ability to trust myself
- Peace

## Getting Out

> **Two Things Saved Me**
>
> 1. **ERP** (Exposure and Response Prevention)
> 2. **Zoloft**

### ERP: Exposure and Response Prevention

**The method:** Face the triggering thoughts and *not* doing the compulsion.
- Let the anxiety spike
- Don't check
- Don't analyze
- Don't seek reassurance

> **What It Feels Like**
>
> Every exposure felt like stepping off a ledge into an endless year of pain. Your brain screams:
> - If you don't do the compulsion, the anxiety will never stop
> - This time is different
> - You'll be stuck in this feeling forever

**You step off anyway.**

The anxiety peaks, then fades. Each time you resist, you teach your brain the thought isn't dangerous.

### Zoloft: Chemical Support

**What it did:** Turned down the volume
- The thoughts still came, but quieter
- Easier to dismiss
- Enough space to actually do the exposure work

**The reality:** It wasn't quick. It wasn't easy. But it worked.

## Why I'm Good at Ultra Distance Endurance Sports

> **The Connection**
>
> I've already been through all the pain I can handle.

When you've spent years with your own mind as the enemy, when you've white-knuckled through days where your brain was convinced you were a monster, where every small action felt like it could trigger catastrophe—physical suffering becomes almost simple.

### Km 205 of an Ultra

**It hurts. But:**
- It's clean pain
- It has a finish line
- It doesn't whisper that you're fundamentally broken

> **The Real Reason**
>
> I'm not good at ultra distance endurance sports **despite** my mental health history. I'm good at them **because** of it.
>
> **What OCD taught me:**
> - I can survive things that feel unsurvivable
> - The anxiety peaks and then fades
> - How to keep moving when everything says stop

## Today

The thoughts still come sometimes. They don't control me anymore.

> **If You Recognize Yourself in This**
>
> - It has a name
> - It's treatable
> - You're not what your brain says you are

**You're not your thoughts. You never were.**
