Currently: 4.0 GPA in CS classes, six hackathon wins, a 70.3 Ironman, seven internship offers.

Not my tempo.

This semester I'm taking four technical courses while working full-time. In May I start at a quant desk, join a research lab, and race a 140.6 Ironman. Weekly: Strength training 5x, 2x swimming, 2x running, 2x cycling. I have a lot of ground to cover and not a lot of time.

Sometimes I think I ought to find balance. But I know I'd rather be exceptional.
