2025 was a strong year: 4.0 GPA in CS coursework, six hackathon wins, a 70.3 Ironman, and seven internship offers.

2026 is about building on that momentum. This semester I'm taking four technical courses while working full-time at Firefox. In May I transition to a quantitative trading role, join a research lab, and race a full Ironman.

Outside of work, I train consistently — strength 5x/week, swimming, running, and cycling. I've found that physical discipline reinforces the mental kind.

Looking forward to what this year brings.
