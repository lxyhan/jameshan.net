1. **Концерт в Баграме** — Каскад (1988). Live concert at Bagram Air Base in the final months of the Soviet-Afghan War. Soldiers singing for soldiers about what they saw and who they lost.

2. **Power, Corruption & Lies** — New Order (1983). Post-punk meets synth-pop. "Blue Monday" came from these sessions but didn't make the album. What did make it is better.

3. **Townes Van Zandt** — Townes Van Zandt (1969). Sparse, acoustic, devastating. "Waiting Around to Die" is on here. So is "For the Sake of the Song."

4. **This Is Happening** — LCD Soundsystem (2010). Dance music for people who read too much. Nine-minute songs that earn every second.

5. **The Social Network** — Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (2010). Score that defined a decade of tech anxiety. Cold, precise, melancholy.
