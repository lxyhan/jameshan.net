`PythonTA` sits at the heart of UofT's intro CS pipeline, running AST transforms, style checks, and feedback generation for thousands of students.

`MarkUs` is the production-grade Rails/Postgres/React platform that handles assignments, submissions, annotations, rubrics, and grading for entire departments.

After eight months in SDS, I've touched ASTs, Rails associations, SQL functions, i18n strings, frontend JS event models, and 50+ RSpec files. I now understand what *real* production engineering feels like.

## Acknowledgments

Everything in this series was built under the guidance, code reviews, and (sometimes humbling) comments from **David Liu** and the SDS team. Their feedback shaped how I write, think, and communicate as an engineer.

This retrospective is a thank-you note as much as it is a summary.
