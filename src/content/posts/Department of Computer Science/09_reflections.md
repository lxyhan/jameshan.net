# Beyond Code

*How SDS shaped me as an engineer.*

---

SDS didn't just improve my code. It changed how I operate in every technical environment.

## At Mozilla

Telemetry work now feels natural because SDS taught me:
- Correctness over speed
- Incremental PRs
- Multi-layer feature logic

Code review discipline came directly from eight months of learning how David reviews PRs.

## At RBC Capital Markets

MarkUs and PythonTA taught me that the best engineers aren't the ones who know everything—they're the ones who ask the right questions.

- **Ask early, ask often.** Clarifying requirements upfront saves hours of rework.
- **Learn from every code review.** Every comment is a lesson.
- **Admit when you don't understand.** The fastest way to learn is to say "I don't know."
- **Collaborate, don't isolate.** The best solutions come from discussing trade-offs with peers.

In quantitative trading, where correctness is non-negotiable and markets move fast, this mindset is critical.

## For Anthropic @ UofT, Blueprint, and UofT AI

Presenting SDS work every week taught me:
- How to lead technical discussions
- How to teach concepts cleanly
- How to deliver feedback kindly
- How to design slides under pressure

## What I'm Most Grateful For

**David Liu's code reviews** — The best feedback I've received in my career so far. Precise, kind, rigorous.

**The SDS community** — High bar but supportive. I always felt like my work mattered.

**The opportunity to work at university scale** — It's rare for students to touch production code that thousands rely on.

## Habits I'm Carrying Forward

- Ship small
- Test thoroughly
- Ask good questions
- Write for humans
- Treat code review as collaboration, not evaluation
- Document openly

---

This is my last semester with SDS before going full-time into Firefox engineering, quantitative trading, and leading student organizations.

But the habits I built here stay with me forever.

Thank you to everyone who made this experience possible.
