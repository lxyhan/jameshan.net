I took this class in the summer of 2024. These notes are just for me to refresh the material and for anyone else looking to review multivariable calculus.

## Topics

1. **Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates** - Alternative ways to describe curves
2. **Vectors** - The language of multivariable calculus
3. **Vector Functions and Space Curves** - Curves in 3D, motion in space
4. **Differential Calculus of Several Variables** - Partial derivatives, gradients, optimization
5. **Integral Calculus of Several Variables** - Double and triple integrals
6. **Line Integrals** - Integrating along curves
7. **Surface Integrals** - Integrating over surfaces
8. **Vector Calculus Theorems** - Green's, Stokes', and Divergence theorems

## Why Multivariable Calculus?

Single-variable calculus deals with functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. But most real-world quantities depend on multiple variables:
- Temperature depends on position $(x, y, z)$ and time $t$
- Electric fields are vector functions of position
- Fluid flow involves velocity fields in 3D space

Multivariable calculus provides the tools to analyze these situations.
