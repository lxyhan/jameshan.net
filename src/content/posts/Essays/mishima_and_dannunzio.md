title: "A Criticism of Mishima and D'Annunzio"
pubDate: '2025-12-30'

In 1970, Yukio Mishima walked into a Tokyo military base with four followers, took a general hostage, and demanded the restoration of imperial power. When the soldiers laughed at his balcony speech, he went inside and committed ritual suicide. A photographer was present. This was planned.

In 1919, Gabriele D'Annunzio (decadent poet, war hero, aesthete) seized the city of Fiume with 2,600 irregulars and governed it through daily balcony speeches, parades, and spectacle. Mussolini called him the prophet. D'Annunzio called politics "the art of beautiful gestures."

Why do these men (one a fascist novelist, one a proto-fascist poet) keep appearing in the reading lists of young men who claim they aren't fascists? The answer isn't that their admirers are crypto-reactionaries. It's that Mishima and D'Annunzio diagnose something real. Modern life is disembodied, soft, lacking stakes. Young men especially feel unforged: nothing hard has happened to them. The world is comfortable. And comfort is unbearable.

The appeal isn't the politics. It's the aesthetic of seriousness. Discipline. Integration of body and ethics. Intensity. The sense that life can be lived at full capacity. This isn't pathology. It's responding to a real absence.

But their cure (aestheticized violence, tribal belonging, death-as-fulfillment) is both ethically monstrous and intellectually lazy. The challenge isn't rejecting intensity. It's building an aesthetic of seriousness that expands the circle rather than contracts it.

## 1. The Diagnosis and Why It Fails

### The Paradox of Abundance

By every historical measure, modern life is a miracle. You have access to the sum of human knowledge in your pocket. Healthcare that would have seemed like magic a century ago. Food security most of human history couldn't imagine. Climate-controlled homes. Entertainment on demand. You will likely live to 80. Your children will not die of smallpox. You have never experienced famine.

Japan, where Mishima wrote, is one of the wealthiest countries in human history. Universal healthcare. Low crime. Technological abundance. Material comfort beyond what emperors once enjoyed. And yet: Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the developed world. Hikikomori (social withdrawal) affects hundreds of thousands. Epidemic loneliness. Pervasive meaninglessness. Birth rates collapsing not from poverty, but from the sense that life lacks purpose.

This is the contradiction of late modernity: **material abundance doesn't produce meaning. Sometimes it eliminates the conditions for it.**

Mishima's *Sun and Steel*:

> "I had long been aware that between action and word there exists a disparity that cannot be resolved by words alone."

He's describing something specific: the dissociation between thought and body under advanced capitalism. You work in an office. Your body is irrelevant. You consume culture. Your participation is passive. You are materially comfortable. Nothing tests you. Result: A life of comfort without stakes.

From a Marxist perspective: alienation from labor. Your work has no tangible product. You don't see the result of what you make. Your participation in the economy is abstract. You click buttons, send emails, attend meetings. From an existential perspective: comfort eliminates struggle, and struggle is how humans have always found meaning. There is no external crisis to orient yourself against.

Young men in particular feel this absence. They have never been tested. No war. No famine. No collapse. They are soft not because they chose to be, but because nothing demanded otherwise. This is the seduction of Mishima's *bushido* fantasies, the gym aesthetic, the obsession with discipline. It's not about the militarism; it's about wanting your body to matter.

D'Annunzio called bourgeois life "the gray." When he seized Fiume in 1919, he didn't govern: he performed. Daily balcony speeches, military parades, public rituals, governance as spectacle. Politics as beauty. Life as intensity. Bureaucracy as spiritual death.

This is a material critique of modern life: office work, consumption, screen time, alienated labor. Your body doesn't matter. Your participation is passive. Everything is mediated. Mishima and D'Annunzio offer something different: a narrative where your life is the protagonist.

### The Aesthetic Move

Mishima didn't write a treatise on why seppuku was necessary. He performed it. D'Annunzio didn't advocate for nationalism. He embodied it in balcony speeches to adoring crowds. This is why they land harder than political philosophy.

The mechanisms: beauty (life as art object), myth (personal narrative integrated into historical destiny), ritual (the body in service of meaning), sacrifice (death as the highest aesthetic act). Why this works: It bypasses argument. It appeals to feeling, not reason. And feeling is how most people experience politics.

### Why They're Seductive (And Available)

Here's the real gap: Modern material life—office jobs, screen time, consumption—doesn't offer stakes. This isn't about liberalism vs. authoritarianism. Liberal democracies can inspire intensity (civil rights movements, abolition, the International Brigades). The problem is material conditions: stable, comfortable, mediated existence.

When young men feel this absence, Mishima and D'Annunzio are what's still available in the cultural water supply. Not because their diagnosis is right or their solution is better, but because they're what remains after everything else collapsed.

The real axis isn't fascism vs. liberalism. It's intensity-offering ideologies (fascism, communism, revolutionary movements, religious crusades) vs. modern material comfort (stable jobs, procedural life, mediated experience). Fascism isn't special. Communism offered the same thing: world-historical mission, enemies to fight, comrades to die beside. The difference was the direction (universal solidarity vs. tribal exclusion), not the presence of intensity.

What happened: all the intensity-offering ideologies either lost or discredited themselves. Fascism was defeated and became taboo. Communism collapsed. Revolutionary nationalism spent itself. Religious crusade was secularized away. What's left is comfort and stability, not because these answered the hunger for meaning, but because everything else either failed or killed millions.

The result: young men feel the absence and reach for what's left. Mishima's aesthetics. The dissident right. Tradition and discipline. Not because these are right, but because they're available.

### Why It's Wrong

Mishima's entire project is intensity as its own justification. In *Sun and Steel*, he describes bodybuilding as forging the self into a "classical statue." The goal isn't health; it's aesthetic totality. The problem: Intensity in service of what?

Mishima died for the restoration of imperial power, a cause that was already irrelevant in 1970. His death had no political effect. It was purely aesthetic. D'Annunzio at Fiume: spectacle as governance, myth as policy. And when Mussolini came to power, he took D'Annunzio's aesthetics and built a horror.

What about the weak? What about those who can't perform intensity? In Mishima's work, women are almost entirely absent, or present only as objects. In D'Annunzio's Fiume, the excluded were Jews, Slavs, anyone outside the mythic "Italian" identity.

The 1937 problem: Were Germans in 1937 happy? Many were. They had myth, belonging, intensity, purpose. The cost was purchased by exclusion. And then horror. The seduction of tribal aesthetics: they work because contraction is easier than expansion. It's easier to build meaning around us vs. them than around universal solidarity. It's easier to manufacture crisis through enemies than to find meaning without them.

## 2. Intensity Without Fascism

### The International Brigades

The hunger for intensity, sacrifice, and meaning isn't unique to fascism. In 1936, Spain was collapsing into civil war. Young men from 50+ countries (America, Britain, France, Poland, Ireland) traveled to Spain to fight for the Republic. They weren't Spanish. They had no blood ties. Many didn't speak the language. They went to die anyway.

Why? Not tribe. Not blood-and-soil. Solidarity across difference. George Orwell, a British socialist. Hemingway, covering the war as a journalist. Thousands of anonymous workers, students, poets. They had the intensity, the sacrifice, the beauty. But they died for a future, not a past. For liberation, not restoration.

These were communists, anarchists, socialists. They had what Mishima claimed only fascism could offer: world-historical mission, comrades to die beside, a narrative where their lives mattered. The difference wasn't the presence of intensity. It was the direction: expansion instead of contraction, universal solidarity instead of tribal exclusion.

### They Lost

The Republic fell. Franco won. Many of the Brigades were killed. Others were imprisoned, exiled, forgotten. The Spanish anarchists built communes, worker councils, militias organized by shared belief, not ethnicity. They failed. But failure doesn't mean the model is impossible. It means the conditions weren't sufficient.

What they proved: Seriousness in service of expansion is possible. Intensity doesn't require exclusion. Sacrifice doesn't require manufacturing enemies. The same is true of abolitionists who died for universal freedom, resistance fighters in occupied Europe, civil rights marchers who faced violence for dignity.

Why fascist aesthetics spread faster: Tribal belonging is simple. Us vs. them. Blood and soil. The enemy is clear. Universal solidarity is complicated. It requires abstraction. Empathy across difference. Sacrifice for people you'll never meet. But it can be done.

## 3. The Problem of Now

### Spain Had a Crisis

The Spanish Civil War offered a clear enemy (fascism), a clear cause (the Republic, workers' power), and a crisis that made sacrifice legible. Today? Climate activism is real and urgent, but defensive and bureaucratic, hard to aestheticize. Mutual aid is small-scale and real, but offers no climax, no drama. Tech startups: intensity in service of nothing, capitalism with hoodies. The gym: training for nothing, form without content. Maybe the absence isn't accidental.

### The Structural Problem

Modern institutions are too stable for individual sacrifice to matter. In 1936 Spain, one person with a rifle changed outcomes. In 2025, one person signing a petition does not. The hypothesis: late modernity has structurally eliminated the conditions for individual meaning. No great struggle. No clear enemy. Institutions stable enough that heroism is irrelevant. Result: the hunger for intensity persists, but the outlets are gone.

### The Manufactured Crisis

One reason fascist aesthetics persist: they manufacture crisis. "The immigrants are destroying us." "Degeneracy is rotting civilization." "Modernity is spiritual death." They create enemies, stakes, urgency, even when none exist. If you feel unforged, they offer a crisis you can fight. It doesn't matter if the crisis is real. The feeling is.

The alternative? It requires either waiting for real crisis (climate collapse, institutional breakdown) or building meaning structures that don't depend on enemies. Is the latter even possible?

## 4. Camus and the Absurd Alternative

### Sisyphus Without Enemies

Albert Camus faced the same diagnosis as Mishima: life has no inherent meaning, modern existence is absurd, suffering is real. But Camus rejected both suicide and the fascist solution. In *The Myth of Sisyphus*, he argues that meaning comes from the struggle itself, not from the victory or the cause.

Sisyphus is condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain forever. It rolls back down. He climbs again. No progress. No climax. No resolution. Camus writes: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy." Not because the task is meaningful, but because the act of confronting absurdity with defiance is itself the meaning.

This is the opposite of Mishima's aesthetic death. Camus offers intensity through engagement with life, not escape into violence. The struggle to create meaning in an indifferent universe. The refusal to surrender to nihilism or totalitarianism. It's harder to aestheticize than a balcony speech, but it doesn't require enemies.

### The Rebel

In *The Rebel*, Camus critiques both fascism and revolutionary communism. Both offer intensity through absolute commitment to a cause. Both end in murder. The rebel, by contrast, says: "I revolt, therefore we exist." Rebellion against injustice creates solidarity, but doesn't demand total submission to ideology.

Camus fought with the French Resistance, so this wasn't armchair philosophy. He knew intensity firsthand. But he rejected the idea that intensity requires tribal belonging or manufactured crisis. The rebellion is against absurdity itself, not against other humans.

### Self-Actualization Without Exclusion

What Camus offers: discipline and seriousness in service of living fully, not dying beautifully. The athlete who trains not for war but for the act itself. The artist who creates knowing the work won't last. The person who builds meaning through relationships, work, creation, without needing a grand narrative or an enemy to fight.

This is the gap liberalism leaves open. It doesn't tell you *what* to do with your freedom. Camus says: that's the point. You must create it. The intensity comes from the act of creation, from confronting the void and building anyway. It's harder than joining a tribe. But it doesn't lead to horror.

## 7. The Brave New World Problem

### Huxley's Dystopia

In *Brave New World*, there is no suffering, no conflict, no tragedy, perfect stability. Everyone is happy. And it's a dystopia.

The Savage's question:

> "I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."

The Controller's response:

> "You're claiming the right to be unhappy."

### The Dilemma

Mishima's despair and the Savage's despair are the same: modern life offers comfort at the price of meaning. But the cure for fascist meaning can't be the elimination of meaning altogether. The two failures: fascism manufactures meaning through exclusion and violence, while soma-liberalism eliminates struggle, tragedy, stakes, and meaning collapses. Neither is acceptable.

### The Instinct for Intensity

What if the hunger for stakes, sacrifice, intensity is vestigial (an evolutionary artifact that served us in scarce, dangerous environments but has no function in modernity) or bad for stability (a drive that inevitably produces conflict, tribalism, violence)?

The uncomfortable question: Is the desire for intensity incompatible with stable, pluralist, liberal society? If so, the choice is to manage it (like aggression, libido: channel it into harmless outlets), eliminate it (Brave New World solution), or accept periodic collapse (intensity erupts, fascism rises, institutions break).

## 7. Open Question

### What I Don't Know

I don't have an answer. The fascist aesthetic works because it's simple, manufactures enemies, and offers climax without requiring universal ethics. The expansive aesthetic (Spain 1936, abolition, civil rights) works when there's a clear crisis, the enemy is real and external (slavery, fascism, Jim Crow), and sacrifice is legible.

The problem: What if there's no crisis? What if institutions are stable? What if the "enemy" is abstract (climate change, inequality, alienation)? Can we build meaning structures that don't depend on enemies, don't require crisis, and offer intensity without exclusion? Or is this a contradiction?

### What I Suspect

**Hypothesis 1**: The hunger for intensity is not vestigial. It's real. Eliminating it produces *Brave New World*.

**Hypothesis 2**: Meaning structures can exist without enemies, but they require active construction, not passive comfort. Examples that might work: monasticism (discipline, ritual, seriousness without exclusion), exploratory research or art (intensity in service of discovery, not domination), mutual aid at scale (if it became a movement, not just a practice). But these are fragile. They don't have the gravitational pull of tribal belonging.

**Hypothesis 3**: Maybe the problem is structural. Late modernity has eliminated the conditions for individual meaning. Institutions are too stable for heroism to matter. The hunger persists, but the outlets are gone. Result: people reach for fascist aesthetics not because they're true, but because they're *available*.

### What I Think

The fascist answer is obviously wrong. Manufacturing enemies, tribal exclusion, aesthetic violence—these end in horror. But the diagnosis is real: modern life can feel formless, disembodied, lacking in stakes. Comfort alone isn't enough.

The alternative: meaning comes from active construction, not passive consumption or tribal belonging. It requires discipline, but discipline in service of something beyond yourself. Training your body not for war but for mastery. Creating art knowing it might fail. Pursuing truth for its own sake. Building relationships and community through care, not exclusion. Confronting nature—mountains, oceans, the physical world that doesn't care about your narrative.

These don't offer the immediate gratification of a balcony speech or the simplicity of manufactured crisis. They're harder. They require showing up daily without validation. But they offer integration: body and mind, self and world, discipline and meaning. And they don't require enemies.

The hunger for intensity is real. Eliminating it produces *Brave New World*. But intensity doesn't require violence or exclusion. It requires engagement—with difficulty, with the absurd, with the world as it is rather than as myth demands it to be.

The question remains open. The hunger for intensity is real. The fascist answer is wrong. What comes next is still being written.
