Democracy requires knowing what the people want. But how do we know what the people want?

## Why Public Opinion Matters

In theory, representatives respond to constituent preferences. In practice, they need to know what those preferences are.

Public opinion influences:
- Electoral outcomes
- Policy decisions
- Media coverage
- Interest group strategies

Politicians obsessively track polls. Understanding how those polls work (and fail) is essential.

## Scientific Polling

### The Basics

A well-designed poll uses a **random sample** of a population to estimate the views of the whole population.

**Key concepts**:

**Population**: The group you want to learn about (e.g., American adults, likely voters in Michigan)

**Sample**: The subset you actually survey

**Random sampling**: Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is what makes inference possible.

**Sample size**: Larger samples are more precise. Most national polls use 800-1,500 respondents.

**Margin of error**: The range within which the true value likely falls. A poll showing 52% support with a 3% margin of error means support is probably between 49% and 55%.

### Sampling Methods

**Probability sampling**: Random selection. The gold standard. Expensive and difficult.

**Convenience sampling**: Survey whoever's available. Cheap but unreliable.

**Quota sampling**: Ensure the sample matches the population on key demographics. Better than convenience, not as good as probability.

**Online panels**: Recruit large groups, sample from them. Increasingly common as phone response rates collapse.

### The Response Rate Problem

In the 1990s, about 35% of people contacted agreed to be polled. Today it's around 5%.

**Why it matters**: If the 5% who respond differ systematically from the 95% who don't, the poll is biased.

**Weighting**: Pollsters adjust results so the sample matches the population demographically. If young people are underrepresented, their responses count more. This helps but can't fully solve the problem.

## Question Design

How you ask shapes what you learn.

### Question Wording Effects

**Leading questions**: "Do you support the president's irresponsible plan?" will get different results than "Do you support the president's plan?"

**Social desirability bias**: People underreport socially undesirable views (racism, not voting) and overreport desirable ones (charitable giving, recycling).

**Framing effects**: "Estate tax" polls differently than "death tax." Same policy, different words, different results.

### Question Order Effects

Earlier questions prime responses to later ones.

Ask about crime, then ask about race: different results than race, then crime.

Good pollsters randomize question order to minimize these effects.

### Open vs. Closed Questions

**Closed** (multiple choice): Easier to analyze, may force false choices

**Open** (write your own answer): Richer information, harder to code, prone to non-response

Most polls use closed questions for statistical analysis.

## Types of Polls

### Benchmark Polls

Early campaign polls establishing baseline support. "Where are we starting?"

### Tracking Polls

Continuous polling measuring change over time. Rolling samples allow real-time monitoring.

### Exit Polls

Surveys of voters as they leave polling places. Used to project winners and analyze the electorate. (The 2000 Florida exit poll debacle damaged their reputation.)

### Push Polls

Not real polls. Propaganda disguised as research. "Would you be more or less likely to vote for Candidate X if you knew they beat their spouse?"

Designed to spread negative information, not gather data.

### Focus Groups

Small group discussions, not statistical samples. Used for qualitative insight: how people talk about issues, what arguments resonate.

## Evaluating Poll Quality

### Who Conducted It?

Academic and nonpartisan organizations (Pew, Gallup, university polls) are generally more reliable than partisan pollsters or media organizations under deadline pressure.

### What's the Population?

"Adults" is easier to poll than "likely voters." But likely voters predict elections better. Definitions of "likely voter" vary and affect results.

### What's the Methodology?

Phone (landline vs. cell), online, in-person. Each has different biases. Response rates matter.

### What's the Margin of Error?

Standard is about 3%. Beware polls that don't report it.

### What Were the Actual Questions?

Reputable pollsters release full questionnaires. If they don't, be suspicious.

## Poll Aggregation

Individual polls have error. Aggregating multiple polls reduces error.

Sites like FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics combine polls, weighting by quality and recency. Aggregates are more reliable than individual polls.

## The 2016 and 2020 Polling Misses

### 2016

National polls were roughly accurate (Clinton won the popular vote). State polls in the Midwest systematically underestimated Trump support.

**Possible causes**:
- Late-deciding voters broke for Trump
- Education weighting was inadequate (non-college whites were undersampled)
- Social desirability bias (shy Trump voters)

### 2020

Polls overestimated Biden's lead, especially in battleground states. Trump outperformed polls again.

**Possible causes**:
- Differential non-response (Trump supporters less willing to take polls)
- COVID-related turnout changes
- Late campaign shifts

Polling is harder than it used to be. The industry is adapting but hasn't solved the problem.

## Ideology and Public Opinion

### What Americans Believe

Most Americans are **ideologically innocent**. They don't have coherent liberal or conservative belief systems. They have opinions on specific issues that don't fit neat categories.

**Symbolic ideology**: About 35-40% identify as conservative, 25% as liberal, the rest as moderate.

**Operational ideology**: When asked about specific policies (Social Security, Medicare, environmental protection), majorities often support liberal positions.

Americans are "symbolically conservative but operationally liberal."

### Policy Preferences

On most issues, Americans cluster in the center. Strong partisans are vocal minorities.

**Exceptions**: Abortion, guns, and immigration show genuine polarization with fewer people in the middle.

## The Takeaway

Public opinion polling is essential to democracy but inherently imperfect.

Understanding polls means understanding:
- How random sampling works
- Why question wording matters
- How to evaluate poll quality
- Why polls sometimes miss

The gap between what polls measure and what the public actually thinks is why elections still surprise us.
