Federalism is the division of power between national and state governments. It's one of the most contested aspects of American government.

## What Federalism Means

In a federal system, power is shared between levels of government. Neither level is subordinate to the other in its sphere of authority.

**Contrast with alternatives**:
- **Unitary system**: Central government holds all power; local governments exist at its pleasure (France, Japan)
- **Confederation**: States hold primary power; central government is weak (Articles of Confederation, EU)
- **Federal system**: Power divided between national and state governments, each supreme in its own sphere (USA, Germany, Australia)

## Constitutional Basis

Several constitutional provisions establish federalism:

**Enumerated Powers (Article I, Section 8)**: Powers explicitly given to Congress, including the power to tax, regulate commerce, declare war, coin money, and establish post offices.

**Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8)**: Congress can make laws "necessary and proper" for executing its enumerated powers. This is the basis for implied powers.

**Supremacy Clause (Article VI)**: Federal law is "the supreme law of the land." When federal and state law conflict, federal law wins.

**Tenth Amendment**: "Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

## Types of Powers

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Enumerated** | Explicitly listed in Constitution | Coin money, declare war, regulate interstate commerce |
| **Implied** | Derived from necessary and proper clause | Create a national bank, regulate airlines |
| **Reserved** | Belong to states (10th Amendment) | Education, marriage, intrastate commerce |
| **Concurrent** | Shared by both levels | Taxation, building roads, law enforcement |

## How Federalism Works in Practice

### Federal Funding

The federal government uses money to influence state policy:

**Revenue Sharing**: Federal funds with almost no restrictions. Rarely used now.

**Block Grants**: Federal funds for broad purposes (e.g., "community development") with minimal restrictions. States prefer these because of flexibility.

**Categorical Grants**: Federal funds for specific purposes with detailed requirements. The federal government prefers these because they ensure money is used as intended. Most common form of federal aid.

**Mandates**: Federal requirements on states. Unfunded mandates (requirements without money) are controversial.

### Coercion vs. Cooperation

The relationship between federal and state governments has evolved:

**Dual Federalism (1789-1930s)**: "Layer cake" federalism. Federal and state governments operated in separate spheres. States handled most domestic policy.

**Cooperative Federalism (1930s-1970s)**: "Marble cake" federalism. The New Deal blurred lines between federal and state responsibilities. Federal government expanded into education, welfare, infrastructure.

**New Federalism (1970s-present)**: Efforts to return power to states. Nixon's revenue sharing, Reagan's block grants, welfare reform in 1996.

**Coercive Federalism**: Federal government uses mandates and conditions on funding to compel state action.

## Key Supreme Court Cases

The Supreme Court defines the boundary between federal and state power:

### McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

**Facts**: Maryland tried to tax the Bank of the United States.

**Constitutional question**: Can Congress create a bank (not explicitly enumerated)? Can a state tax a federal institution?

**Holding**: Yes, Congress can create a bank under implied powers; No, states cannot tax federal institutions.

**Reasoning**: Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the necessary and proper clause gives Congress implied powers beyond those explicitly listed. "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate... are constitutional." Also, "the power to tax is the power to destroy," so states cannot tax federal institutions.

**Significance**: Established broad interpretation of federal power. Federal supremacy over states.

### United States v. Lopez (1995)

**Facts**: Congress passed the Gun-Free School Zones Act, making it a federal crime to possess a gun near a school.

**Constitutional question**: Does Congress have power under the commerce clause to regulate gun possession near schools?

**Holding**: No. Congress exceeded its commerce clause authority.

**Reasoning**: Gun possession near schools is not economic activity and does not substantially affect interstate commerce. The commerce clause has limits; otherwise, "it would be difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power."

**Significance**: First case in 60 years to limit Congress's commerce clause power. Signaled courts would enforce federalism limits.

## Contemporary Federalism Debates

### Marijuana Legalization

Federal law (Controlled Substances Act) prohibits marijuana. Many states have legalized it for medical or recreational use. Federal law is supreme, but federal enforcement is limited. This creates legal ambiguity.

### Immigration

Federal government controls immigration policy. Some states (Arizona) tried to enforce immigration law themselves. Others (sanctuary cities) refuse to cooperate with federal enforcement. Both raise federalism questions.

### Healthcare

The Affordable Care Act required states to expand Medicaid. NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) held this was unconstitutionally coercive. States could opt out (and many did).

### Education

Education is traditionally a state responsibility, but federal programs (No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top) impose significant requirements as conditions of funding.

### Environment

California sets stricter emissions standards than federal law. Can states be "laboratories of democracy" in environmental policy, or does this create regulatory chaos?

## Advantages of Federalism

**Experimentation**: States can try different policies. Successful experiments spread; failures are contained. Justice Brandeis called states "laboratories of democracy."

**Local adaptation**: Policies can reflect local preferences. What works in Massachusetts may not work in Mississippi.

**Protection against tyranny**: Power is divided between levels of government. Neither can easily dominate.

**Citizen choice**: People can "vote with their feet" by moving to states with policies they prefer.

**Multiple access points**: Citizens have more opportunities to influence government.

## Disadvantages of Federalism

**Inequality**: States provide different levels of services. A child's education or healthcare depends on where they happen to live.

**Race to the bottom**: States may compete by lowering standards (environmental regulations, labor protections, taxes) to attract business.

**Coordination problems**: Fifty different policies create complexity. Businesses must navigate different regulations.

**Inefficiency**: Duplication of efforts. Multiple bureaucracies doing similar things.

**Obstruction**: States can block national policies (segregation under "states' rights").

## The Takeaway

Federalism means the boundary between federal and state power is always contested. Every generation fights about where to draw the line.

The Constitution provides a framework but not clear answers. The necessary and proper clause supports federal expansion. The Tenth Amendment supports state authority. Courts referee the disputes, but their decisions reflect the political and intellectual climate of their time.

Understanding federalism helps explain why American policy is so fragmented. Healthcare, education, environmental policy, criminal justice, marijuana laws, voting procedures, all vary dramatically by state. This is federalism in action.

Whether this fragmentation is a feature (local adaptation, experimentation) or a bug (inequality, inefficiency) depends on your perspective. The debate that began between Federalists and Anti-Federalists continues today.
