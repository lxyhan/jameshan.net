This is the unit where American democracy gets real. We're not talking about abstract constitutional principles anymore—we're talking about who actually shows up, who gets heard, and who wins.

## 5.1 Voting Rights & Models of Voter Behavior

### The Long March to Universal Suffrage

The Constitution originally left voting qualifications to the states, which meant: white, male, property-owning. It took nearly two centuries to fix that.

| Amendment/Act | Year | What It Did |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **15th Amendment** | 1870 | Cannot deny vote based on race |
| **19th Amendment** | 1920 | Women's suffrage |
| **24th Amendment** | 1964 | Banned poll taxes in federal elections |
| **Voting Rights Act** | 1965 | Outlawed literacy tests; federal oversight |
| **26th Amendment** | 1971 | Voting age lowered to 18 |

The 26th Amendment has the best slogan in constitutional history: *"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote."* When you're drafting 18-year-olds to die in Vietnam, telling them they can't vote becomes indefensible.

**The Voting Rights Act of 1965** was the heavy artillery. Section 5 required states with a history of discrimination to get *preclearance*—federal approval before changing election laws. That requirement was gutted by *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), when the Court ruled the coverage formula was outdated.

### How Do Voters Decide?

Political scientists have identified several models:

- **Rational Choice**: Voters calculate costs and benefits, voting for whoever maximizes their self-interest. Homo economicus goes to the polls.

- **Retrospective Voting**: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Judge incumbents on their record.

- **Prospective Voting**: Vote based on predictions about future performance. Campaign promises matter.

- **Party-Line Voting**: Straight ticket. The party label does all the cognitive work.

- **Sociological Model**: Demographics are destiny. Race, religion, income, education, gender—these predict voting behavior better than any policy position.

## 5.2 Voter Turnout

### Who Actually Votes?

Not everyone. And the people who don't vote aren't randomly distributed.

**Demographic factors:**
- **Age**: 65+ voters crush it. 18-24? Lowest turnout. Every election cycle, pundits predict "the youth vote will surge." It rarely does.
- **Education**: More education = higher turnout. Strong correlation.
- **Income**: Wealth predicts participation. Democracy skews toward those who can afford to show up.
- **Efficacy**: Belief that your vote matters. Hard to maintain in safe states.

### Why Is American Turnout So Low?

Compared to other democracies, the US is embarrassingly bad at getting people to vote. Here's why:

1. **Voluntary registration** — Most democracies automatically register citizens. We make you do it yourself.
2. **Tuesday voting** — Why? Because in 1845, farmers needed a day to travel to county seats without interfering with church (Sunday) or market day (Wednesday). We've been stuck ever since.
3. **Winner-take-all** — If you're a Democrat in Wyoming or a Republican in California, your presidential vote is basically ceremonial.
4. **Election fatigue** — We vote constantly. President, Congress, state legislature, county commissioner, school board, ballot initiatives, primaries...

The **Motor Voter Act (1993)** tried to help by letting you register at the DMV. It increased registration but didn't dramatically boost turnout.

## 5.3 Political Parties

### What Parties Actually Do

Parties are the organizational backbone of democracy:

- **Recruit and nominate candidates** — The pipeline from "interested citizen" to "on the ballot"
- **Mobilize voters** — Get-out-the-vote operations, canvassing, phone banking
- **Organize government** — Majority/minority status determines everything in Congress
- **Provide cues** — The (D) or (R) next to a name is a cognitive shortcut
- **Develop platforms** — At least theoretically

### Party Organization

Three levels:
- **National** (DNC/RNC) — Set rules, organize conventions, coordinate messaging
- **State** — Run primaries, coordinate statewide campaigns
- **Local** — Grassroots organizing, the ground game

### Realignment

Sometimes the party coalitions fundamentally restructure. These **critical elections** redraw the map:

- **1860** — Civil War realignment. Republicans become the party of the Union.
- **1932** — New Deal coalition. Democrats become the party of the working class, minorities, and urban voters.
- **1968-1980** — Southern Strategy. The solid Democratic South flips Republican.

**Dealignment** is different—that's when party ties weaken overall, producing more independents.

## 5.4 How Parties Change and Adapt

Parties aren't static. They evolve with the electorate.

### Current Coalitions

**Democrats:** Urban voters, racial minorities, union members, college-educated voters, young voters

**Republicans:** Rural voters, white evangelicals, older voters, non-college white voters

Note how education has become a dividing line. This is relatively new.

### Polarization

The parties have become more ideologically distinct. There used to be liberal Republicans (Northeastern moderates) and conservative Democrats (Southern Blue Dogs). They're nearly extinct now.

**Causes:**
- Gerrymandering creates safe seats where primaries are the real election
- Primary voters are more ideologically extreme than general election voters
- Media ecosystems reinforce existing beliefs
- Geographic sorting—liberals cluster in cities, conservatives in rural areas

## 5.5 Third-Party Politics

### Why Third Parties Fail

The American system is structurally hostile to third parties:

1. **Winner-take-all districts** — Second place gets nothing. No proportional representation.
2. **Electoral College** — Must win *states*, not just popular votes.
3. **Ballot access laws** — Getting on the ballot requires petitions, filing fees, and legal hurdles.
4. **Debate exclusion** — Need 15% in polls to get on stage. Can't get 15% without visibility. Classic catch-22.

### But They Still Matter

Third parties don't win, but they influence:

- **Spoiler effect** — Nader in 2000, Perot in 1992. Whether they "cost" anyone the election is debatable, but major parties fear it.
- **Agenda setting** — Introduce issues that major parties later adopt. The Populist Party pushed the income tax. The Progressive Party pushed women's suffrage. The Green Party mainstreamed environmental concerns.

## 5.6 Interest Groups Influencing Policymaking

### Types of Interest Groups

| Type | Examples | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Economic** | Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO, AMA | Business, labor, professional interests |
| **Public Interest** | ACLU, Sierra Club, NRA | Broad ideological or social goals |
| **Single-Issue** | MADD, pro-life/pro-choice groups | One specific policy area |
| **Ideological** | Heritage Foundation, MoveOn | Promote a political worldview |

### Tactics

**Lobbying** — Direct contact with lawmakers. Provide information, draft legislation, testify at hearings. Lobbyists are useful because legislators don't have time to become experts on everything.

**Litigation** — File lawsuits, submit *amicus curiae* ("friend of the court") briefs. When you can't win in the legislature, try the courts.

**Grassroots Mobilization** — Letter campaigns, protests, rallies. Demonstrate public support (or manufacture the appearance of it).

**Electioneering** — Endorse candidates, mobilize voters, spend money.

### Iron Triangles & Issue Networks

**Iron Triangle**: A stable, mutually beneficial relationship between:
- Interest group
- Congressional committee
- Executive agency

*Example*: Defense contractors ↔ Armed Services Committee ↔ Pentagon

Everyone benefits. The contractors get contracts. The committee members get campaign donations and jobs for constituents. The agency gets budget support.

**Issue Networks** are looser, broader, and more fluid coalitions around policy areas.

## 5.7 Groups Influencing Policy Outcomes

### The Money Game

**PACs (Political Action Committees)**
- Can donate directly to candidates
- Limit: $5,000 per candidate per election
- Must disclose donors

**Super PACs** (post-*Citizens United v. FEC*, 2010)
- Cannot donate directly or coordinate with candidates
- *Unlimited* fundraising and spending
- Must disclose donors

**501(c)(4) "Dark Money" Groups**
- Social welfare organizations
- Can engage in political activity (not primary purpose)
- **Do NOT have to disclose donors**

The practical effect: billions of dollars flow through channels with varying degrees of transparency.

### Social Movements vs. Interest Groups

**Social movements** are broader, less formal, and seek fundamental change: Civil Rights Movement, Tea Party, Black Lives Matter.

**Interest groups** are more organized, narrower, and work within the system.

Movements sometimes spawn interest groups. The environmental movement gave us the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters.

## 5.8 Electing a President

### The Nomination Process

1. **Invisible Primary** — Before any votes, candidates raise money and build support. This is when most candidacies die.

2. **Primaries and Caucuses**
   - *Primaries*: State-run elections. Can be proportional or winner-take-all.
   - *Caucuses*: Party-run meetings. More time-intensive, lower turnout, favors organized campaigns.

3. **Frontloading** — States move their primaries earlier to get more influence. Iowa and New Hampshire guard their first-in-the-nation status jealously.

4. **National Convention** — Officially nominate the candidate, adopt the platform, unify the party. Mostly ceremonial now, but can still produce drama.

### The General Election

**Electoral College Math:**
- 538 total electors (435 House + 100 Senate + 3 for D.C.)
- Need 270 to win
- Winner-take-all in 48 states (Maine and Nebraska split by district)

This creates **battleground states**. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona—these get all the attention. California and Texas? Ignored.

If nobody hits 270, the House decides—but each *state delegation* gets one vote, not each representative. Wyoming equals California.

### The Electoral College Debate

**Pros:**
- Preserves federalism
- Requires building a geographically broad coalition
- Contains fraud—stolen votes in one state can't tip the national result

**Cons:**
- Can produce winners who lose the popular vote (2000, 2016)
- Ignores safe states entirely
- Small states are overrepresented (Wyoming: 1 elector per ~190,000 people. California: 1 per ~720,000)

## 5.9 Congressional Elections

### Incumbency Advantage

Incumbents win ~90% of House races. Why?

- **Name recognition** — You know who they are
- **Franking privilege** — Free mail to constituents
- **Credit claiming** — Casework, constituency service, "I got this for our district"
- **Pork barrel spending** — Bridges, highways, military bases
- **Campaign finance advantage** — Donors back winners
- **Gerrymandering** — Safe districts drawn for them

### Redistricting and Gerrymandering

After each Census, states redraw district lines. This is where things get ugly.

**Gerrymandering techniques:**
- **Packing**: Concentrate opponents in a few districts (they win big, but in fewer places)
- **Cracking**: Spread opponents across many districts (they never reach a majority anywhere)

**Key cases:**
- *Shaw v. Reno* (1993) — Racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional
- *Rucho v. Common Cause* (2019) — Partisan gerrymandering is a "political question" federal courts won't touch

So racial gerrymanders: unconstitutional. Partisan gerrymanders: not our problem, says the Supreme Court.

### Midterm Elections

The president's party almost always loses seats. Lower turnout. Serves as a referendum on the administration.

## Key Cases to Know

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *Shelby County v. Holder* | 2013 | Gutted VRA preclearance formula |
| *Citizens United v. FEC* | 2010 | Corporations/unions can spend unlimited amounts; created Super PACs |
| *Shaw v. Reno* | 1993 | Racial gerrymandering unconstitutional |
| *Rucho v. Common Cause* | 2019 | Partisan gerrymandering not justiciable by federal courts |

## The Bottom Line

American political participation is defined by paradox:

We have the world's oldest continuous democracy, but one of the lowest turnout rates among developed nations. We celebrate voter empowerment while maintaining systems that dilute votes and discourage participation. We decry the influence of money in politics while protecting it as speech.

Understanding these tensions isn't just exam prep—it's understanding how power actually works.
