## Course Overview

An introduction to methods for automated learning of relationships on the basis of empirical data:

- Classification and regression using nearest neighbour methods, decision trees, linear models, and neural networks
- Clustering algorithms
- Problems of overfitting and assessing accuracy

2. **Decision Trees** — Splitting criteria, information gain, pruning
3. **Linear Regression** — Least squares, closed-form solution, gradient descent
4. **Linear Classification** — Logistic regression, softmax, cross-entropy loss
5. **Neural Networks** — Architecture, activation functions, forward pass
6. **Training Neural Networks** — Backpropagation, optimization, regularization

### Part II: Unsupervised Learning
