title: "A Criticism of Mishima and D'Annunzio"

In 1970, Yukio Mishima walked into a Tokyo military base with four followers, took a general hostage, and demanded the restoration of imperial power. When the soldiers laughed at his balcony speech, he went inside and committed ritual suicide. A photographer was present. This was planned.

In 1919, Gabriele D'Annunzio (decadent poet, war hero, aesthete) seized the city of Fiume with 2,600 irregulars and governed it through daily balcony speeches, parades, and spectacle. Mussolini called him the prophet. D'Annunzio called politics "the art of beautiful gestures."

Why do these men (one a fascist novelist, one a proto-fascist poet) keep appearing in the reading lists of young men who claim they aren't fascists? The answer isn't that their admirers are crypto-reactionaries. It's that Mishima and D'Annunzio diagnose something real. Modern life is disembodied, soft, lacking stakes. Young men especially feel unforged: nothing hard has happened to them. The world is comfortable. And comfort is unbearable.

The appeal isn't the politics. It's the aesthetic of seriousness. Discipline. Integration of body and ethics. Intensity. The sense that life can be lived at full capacity. This isn't pathology. It's responding to a real absence.

But their cure (aestheticized violence, tribal belonging, death-as-fulfillment) is both ethically monstrous and intellectually lazy. The challenge isn't rejecting intensity. It's building an aesthetic of seriousness that expands the circle rather than contracts it.

## 1. The Diagnosis (What They Get Right)

### Modern Life Is Formless

Mishima's *Sun and Steel*:

> "I had long been aware that between action and word there exists a disparity that cannot be resolved by words alone."

He's describing something specific: the dissociation between thought and body in modern life. You work in an office. Your body is irrelevant. You consume culture. Your participation is passive. You are comfortable. Nothing tests you. Result: A life of comfort without stakes.

Young men in particular feel this absence. They have never been tested. No war. No famine. No collapse. They are soft not because they chose to be, but because nothing demanded otherwise. This is the seduction of Mishima's *bushido* fantasies, the gym aesthetic, the obsession with discipline. It's not about the militarism; it's about wanting your body to matter.

### D'Annunzio's Escape from the Gray

Gabriele D'Annunzio was a hedonist, a war pilot, a poet who lived in a villa filled with artifacts and lovers. He called bourgeois life "the gray." When he seized Fiume in 1919, he didn't govern: he performed. Daily balcony speeches, military parades, public rituals, governance as spectacle. The implicit argument: Politics should be beautiful. Life should be intense. Bureaucracy is spiritual death.

And he's not entirely wrong. Procedural liberalism (voting, institutions, compromise) offers stability. But it offers no drama, no myth, no climax. It doesn't stir the blood. Mishima and D'Annunzio offer something liberalism doesn't: a narrative where your life is the protagonist.

## 2. The Aesthetic Move

### They Don't Argue. They Show.

Mishima didn't write a treatise on why seppuku was necessary. He performed it. D'Annunzio didn't advocate for nationalism. He embodied it in balcony speeches to adoring crowds. This is why they land harder than political philosophy.

The mechanisms: beauty (life as art object), myth (personal narrative integrated into historical destiny), ritual (the body in service of meaning), sacrifice (death as the highest aesthetic act). Why this works: It bypasses argument. It appeals to feeling, not reason. And feeling is how most people experience politics.

### Why the Left Fails Here

The left has critique. It has policy. It has theory. What it lacks: a competing aesthetic of intensity. The contrast is stark. Mishima: "I will die beautifully for an impossible cause." Liberal activism: "Sign this petition. Vote. Donate." One is a climax. The other is homework.

Climate activism? Defensive, bureaucratic, hard to aestheticize. Mutual aid? Real but small-scale. No drama. DSA meetings? Robert's Rules of Order is not a mythology. Fascism offers meaning through exclusion. The liberal project offers comfort through inclusion. But comfort isn't a narrative. It's the absence of one.

## 3. The Hole

### Intensity Without Ethics

Mishima's entire project is intensity as its own justification. In *Sun and Steel*, he describes bodybuilding as forging the self into a "classical statue." The goal isn't health; it's aesthetic totality. The problem: Intensity in service of what?

Mishima died for the restoration of imperial power, a cause that was already irrelevant in 1970. His death had no political effect. It was purely aesthetic. D'Annunzio at Fiume: spectacle as governance, myth as policy. And when Mussolini came to power, he took D'Annunzio's aesthetics and built a horror.

### Who Gets Excluded?

What about the weak? What about those who can't perform intensity? In Mishima's work, women are almost entirely absent, or present only as objects. In D'Annunzio's Fiume, the excluded were Jews, Slavs, anyone outside the mythic "Italian" identity.

The 1937 problem: Were Germans in 1937 happy? Many were. They had myth, belonging, intensity, purpose. The cost was purchased by exclusion. And then horror. The seduction of tribal aesthetics: they work because contraction is easier than expansion. It's easier to build meaning around us vs. them than around universal solidarity. It's easier to manufacture crisis through enemies than to find meaning without them.

### The Counter-Examples Exist

Beauty, sacrifice, and intensity can serve liberation. Abolitionists who died for universal freedom. Resistance fighters in occupied Europe. Civil rights marchers who faced violence for dignity. But these movements are harder to aestheticize because they're based on expansion, not contraction.

Why fascist aesthetics spread faster: Tribal belonging is simple. Us vs. them. Blood and soil. The enemy is clear. Universal solidarity is complicated. It requires abstraction. Empathy across difference. Sacrifice for people you'll never meet.

## 4. The Counter-Aesthetic: Spain 1936

### The International Brigades

In 1936, fascism was rising. Spain was collapsing into civil war. Young men from 50+ countries (America, Britain, France, Poland, Ireland) traveled to Spain to fight for the Republic. They weren't Spanish. They had no blood ties. Many didn't speak the language. They went to die anyway.

Why? Not tribe. Not blood-and-soil. Solidarity across difference. George Orwell, a British socialist. Hemingway, covering the war as a journalist. Thousands of anonymous workers, students, poets. They had the intensity, the sacrifice, the beauty. But they died for a future, not a past. For liberation, not restoration.

### They Lost

The Republic fell. Franco won. Many of the Brigades were killed. Others were imprisoned, exiled, forgotten. But they proved something: Seriousness in service of expansion is possible. Intensity doesn't require exclusion. Sacrifice doesn't require enemies.

The Spanish anarchists: communes, worker councils, militias organized by shared belief, not ethnicity. They failed. But failure doesn't mean the model is impossible. It means the conditions weren't sufficient.

## 5. The Problem of Now

### Spain Had a Crisis

The Spanish Civil War offered a clear enemy (fascism), a clear cause (the Republic, workers' power), and a crisis that made sacrifice legible. Today? Climate activism is real and urgent, but defensive and bureaucratic, hard to aestheticize. Mutual aid is small-scale and real, but offers no climax, no drama. Tech startups: intensity in service of nothing, capitalism with hoodies. The gym: training for nothing, form without content. Maybe the absence isn't accidental.

### The Structural Problem

Modern institutions are too stable for individual sacrifice to matter. In 1936 Spain, one person with a rifle changed outcomes. In 2025, one person signing a petition does not. The hypothesis: late modernity has structurally eliminated the conditions for individual meaning. No great struggle. No clear enemy. Institutions stable enough that heroism is irrelevant. Result: the hunger for intensity persists, but the outlets are gone.

### The Fascist Advantage

Fascism manufactures crisis. "The immigrants are destroying us." "Degeneracy is rotting civilization." "Modernity is spiritual death." It creates enemies, stakes, urgency, even when none exist. If you feel unforged, fascism offers a crisis you can fight. It doesn't matter if the crisis is real. The feeling is.

The non-fascist version? It requires either waiting for real crisis (climate collapse, institutional breakdown) or building meaning structures that don't depend on enemies. Is the latter even possible?

## 6. The Brave New World Problem

### Huxley's Dystopia

In *Brave New World*, there is no suffering, no conflict, no tragedy, perfect stability. Everyone is happy. And it's a dystopia.

The Savage's question:

> "I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."

The Controller's response:

> "You're claiming the right to be unhappy."

### The Dilemma

Mishima's despair and the Savage's despair are the same: modern life offers comfort at the price of meaning. But the cure for fascist meaning can't be the elimination of meaning altogether. The two failures: fascism manufactures meaning through exclusion and violence, while soma-liberalism eliminates struggle, tragedy, stakes, and meaning collapses. Neither is acceptable.

### The Instinct for Intensity

What if the hunger for stakes, sacrifice, intensity is vestigial (an evolutionary artifact that served us in scarce, dangerous environments but has no function in modernity) or bad for stability (a drive that inevitably produces conflict, tribalism, violence)?

The uncomfortable question: Is the desire for intensity incompatible with stable, pluralist, liberal society? If so, the choice is to manage it (like aggression, libido: channel it into harmless outlets), eliminate it (Brave New World solution), or accept periodic collapse (intensity erupts, fascism rises, institutions break).

---

## 7. Open Question

### What I Don't Know

I don't have an answer. The fascist aesthetic works because it's simple, manufactures enemies, and offers climax without requiring universal ethics. The expansive aesthetic (Spain 1936, abolition, civil rights) works when there's a clear crisis, the enemy is real and external (slavery, fascism, Jim Crow), and sacrifice is legible.

The problem: What if there's no crisis? What if institutions are stable? What if the "enemy" is abstract (climate change, inequality, alienation)? Can we build meaning structures that don't depend on enemies, don't require crisis, and offer intensity without exclusion? Or is this a contradiction?

### What I Suspect

Hypothesis 1: The hunger for intensity is not vestigial. It's real. Eliminating it produces Brave New World.

Hypothesis 2: Meaning structures can exist without enemies, but they require active construction, not passive comfort. Examples that might work: monasticism (discipline, ritual, seriousness without exclusion), exploratory research or art (intensity in service of discovery, not domination), mutual aid at scale (if it became a movement, not just a practice). But these are fragile. They don't have the gravitational pull of tribal belonging.

### The Reader's Question

If you've gotten this far, I want to hear from you: Do you feel the absence Mishima describes? Do you think intensity requires enemies? Is there a way to build seriousness without exclusion, or is that a fantasy?

I don't know. But I know the fascist answer is wrong. And I know the liberal answer ("just be comfortable") is insufficient. So what's left?
