A young Napoleon is certain he will rule France.

He studies military history obsessively. Writes treatises on artillery, on governance. He understands that history has a shape, and he is part of it. The feeling isn't ambition. It's quieter. A fact about the world he hasn't yet proven.

At 28, he launches his first coup. It fails. At 32, he tries again. Failure, prison, escape, exile. He wanders Europe writing political philosophy. He waits.

At 40, he finally becomes Emperor.

And then he proves the feeling had lied. He stumbles into a catastrophic war with Prussia. His army is encircled at Sedan. He surrenders personally to Bismarck. He is deposed. He dies in exile three years later.

This was Napoleon III. The nephew. The farce.

His uncle had the same feeling. The difference is his uncle was right.

## The Feeling

What do you do with a conviction you can't verify?

Some people carry it from childhood. A sense of being meant for something. Not arrogance, but quieter. More like a fact about the world that happens to involve you. You don't choose it. It's just there, the way some people are left-handed.

Napoleon I had it. He wrote to his brother at 22: "I have no fear of death. I feel myself above personal misfortune." At that point he was a minor artillery officer with no prospects. Corsican accent. No connections. No money.

Within a decade, he would command the largest army in European history.

Napoleon III had the same feeling. So did countless people history erased. The problem is obvious: the feeling is necessary but not sufficient. It tells you nothing about whether you're right.

Worse, it might be negatively correlated with self-knowledge. The uncle and the nephew felt identical certainty. One was genius recognizing itself. The other was inheritance mistaken for destiny.

**From inside, they're indistinguishable.**

## The Red Napoleon

Mikhail Tukhachevsky was called the Red Napoleon by western observers, and he earned the title.

Born in 1893 to minor Russian nobility, he joined the Tsar's army at 21 and was captured by the Germans within months. He escaped five times. On the fifth attempt, he made it.

He joined the Bolsheviks in 1918, not out of ideological conviction but because the Revolution was the only game that matched his ambitions. Within two years, at 27, he commanded an entire front in the Civil War. He crushed the White armies in Siberia. He nearly took Warsaw before his supply lines collapsed.

By 30, he was one of the most powerful military figures in Soviet Russia.

Tukhachevsky had the feeling. He also had the genius. He pioneered "deep battle" doctrine, the theory of mechanized warfare that would later define World War II. He built the Soviet tank corps and air force from scratch. While other generals were still thinking about cavalry charges, he was gaming out how armor and aircraft would transform combined arms operations.

He was right about everything. The Wehrmacht would prove it in 1941, using tactics he'd developed a decade earlier.

So Tukhachevsky had the feeling. He had the genius. He had his moment. All three, like the uncle.

In 1937, Stalin had him arrested on fabricated charges of conspiracy with Nazi Germany. He was tortured, confessed to crimes he didn't commit, and was shot within 24 hours. He was 44.

A man who was right about everything, destroyed by forces he didn't model. Tukhachevsky understood mechanized warfare better than anyone alive. He didn't understand Stalin.

The irony is total. He spent his whole life building the instrument that might have saved the Soviet Union from Germany. Stalin destroyed him, purged the officer corps, and then watched the Wehrmacht use Tukhachevsky's own tactics to drive to the gates of Moscow.

## The Marxist Critique

Marx had a word for all of this: *Bonapartism*.

In *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon*, he wrote history's most famous diagnosis of Napoleon III: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce." The uncle was the tragedy, a genuine rupture, a man who actually bent history. The nephew was the farce, a mediocrity elevated by name recognition, playing at revolution.

But Marx's critique went deeper than mockery. Bonapartism, in his analysis, is what happens when class conflict reaches a stalemate. The bourgeoisie can't rule directly. The proletariat isn't strong enough to take power. Into this vacuum steps the strongman, someone who appears to transcend class, to represent the nation itself, to be above the petty interests of factions.

The Bonapartist leader seems to bend the system to his will. In reality, he serves it. He provides the *illusion* of agency, of historical mastery, while the actual structure remains intact. Napoleon III thought he was shaping France. He was a symptom of its paralysis.

Here's the uncomfortable question: was Napoleon I any different? Was Tukhachevsky?

The Revolution needed someone. It had destroyed the old order and couldn't stabilize the new one. The Soviet state needed military modernizers. Maybe all "great men" are Bonapartist illusions, people who believe they're bending history when they're actually being selected by it. The system produces people who feel like protagonists, and the ones who happen to fit the moment get remembered as geniuses.

The Marxist answer is: recognize that it's an illusion. The feeling of being a protagonist is ideology. You're not above the system; you're its product. The healthiest thing is to dissolve the impulse entirely, to accept that history is made by structures and classes, not by individuals who feel special.

I understand this critique. I can't accept it.

Not because I think I'm immune to self-deception. I'm probably not. But because the alternative is a kind of preemptive surrender. If the feeling is always false, you never have to test it. You never have to risk being the farce. You also never find out if you might have been the tragedy.

The question isn't whether Bonapartism is a trap. It obviously can be. The question is whether the trap is avoidable, or whether the only options are delusion and resignation.

## The Wrong Optimization

The fear isn't failure. Failure is survivable, even useful. The fear is the wrong arena.

Napoleon III got the throne. He ruled for eighteen years. And the throne is what revealed him as the farce. Success didn't resolve the question. It answered it, definitively, in the worst possible way.

Consider a different Napoleon. One who never went to Toulon.

In 1793, the siege of Toulon needed an artillery commander. The previous one had been wounded. Napoleon happened to be nearby. He proposed a plan, it worked, and within months he was a general. Without that accident of proximity, he might have remained a minor officer. Competent. Respected. Anonymous.

There's a version of Napoleon who took a job in the Ministry of Finance because it was stable and used his talents well enough. Who became a successful banker in Paris and never commanded an army.

I think about him constantly.

Not because his life would have been bad. By any reasonable metric, it would have been good. But it would have been a life in the wrong arena. Every year optimizing for one game is a year losing fluency in another. Skills that don't transfer. Networks in the wrong world. A mind slowly shaped by the wrong problems.

The banker Napoleon never finds out what he actually was. That's the failure mode that keeps me up at night.

## The Problem of Paths

Napoleon I's path was legible. Artillery school, Toulon, Italian campaign, First Consul, Emperor. The ladder existed. The rungs were visible. Genius could climb it.

Napoleon III's problem wasn't ability. He was intelligent, strategic, patient. His problem was that the ladder no longer fit. He inherited a name, not a context. He spent decades trying to recreate a path that history had closed.

The Revolution made Napoleon I possible. It cleared out the aristocracy, created a meritocratic army, and produced a power vacuum that genius could fill. By the time Napoleon III came of age, the vacuum was gone. The institutions had stabilized. There was no artillery problem waiting for a solution.

He tried to manufacture his moment. The coups, the exile, the manifestos. He eventually succeeded through elections, not conquest. And then he spent eighteen years trying to be his uncle in a world that no longer needed an uncle.

Tukhachevsky had a legible path too. Revolution creates vacuums. The Bolsheviks needed military talent and didn't care about credentials. A lieutenant could become a marshal in five years if he was good enough. The ladder existed, and he climbed it.

But the ladder only went so far. It led into Stalin's orbit, and Stalin's orbit had room for exactly one protagonist.

What's the 2025 equivalent?

For a mind shaped by history, game theory, systems design: where's the Toulon? There isn't one. No siege to solve. No army waiting for a commander.

Maybe I was born in the wrong era. Or maybe I can't see this era's shape.

## The Bismarck Counter

Not everyone is Napoleon. Some are Bismarck.

Otto von Bismarck was a mediocre law student. A failed bureaucrat. He managed his family's estates for a decade through his late twenties and early thirties. The "mad Junker," drinking, dueling, drifting. His mother had wanted him to be a diplomat. He couldn't hold a government job.

Except he wasn't drifting. He was reading. He watched the 1848 revolutions sweep through Europe and fail. He studied why. He built a model of power: what actually moved states, how coalitions formed and fractured, where the leverage points were.

When the moment came (a parliament seat, almost by accident) he was ready in a way the credentialed weren't. Within a decade, he had unified Germany through three precisely calibrated wars. He served as Chancellor for nearly thirty years.

**The estate wasn't the thing. It was cover for the thing.**

This is the question I can't answer from inside: can you tell the difference between preparation and drift? Bismarck spending a decade on the estate looks like failure. It was actually the precondition for everything that followed.

## The Asymmetry

Tukhachevsky's story doesn't discourage me. Somehow, it does the opposite.

A life that mattered, cut short by forces outside his control. Forty-four years, and in that time he revolutionized military doctrine, commanded armies, shaped the structure of a superpower's defense. Then a bullet in a basement.

I've interrogated this preference and I can't dissolve it. A consequential life cut short beats a long life in the wrong arena. The years don't matter as much as what you do with them.

Maybe this is youth talking. Maybe at 40 I'll feel differently. But right now, the asymmetry holds.

## The Toulon Problem

Here's what I've realized: Toulon wasn't announced in advance.

Napoleon didn't know, when he showed up at the siege, that this was his moment. It was a military problem that happened to need his specific solution. He was in the right place with the right skills, and he recognized the opportunity when it appeared.

The question isn't "where's my Toulon?" Toulon-seeking is what Napoleon III did for twenty years. It's a recipe for forcing moments that aren't there.

The question is: what am I building that would let me recognize a Toulon if it appeared?

Napoleon had spent years studying artillery, fortification, military history. Not because he knew Toulon was coming. He didn't. Because the preparation was intrinsically compelling to him. When the moment came, the preparation was already done.

Bismarck had spent a decade building a model of power. Not because he knew German unification was coming. Because the model-building was how he understood the world.

Tukhachevsky had spent years theorizing mechanized warfare. He recognized what armor could do before anyone else. When the Soviet state needed someone to build its tank corps, he was the obvious choice.

Maybe the answer isn't to find the ladder. Maybe it's to build the thing that would let you see the ladder when it materializes. To stay ready for a moment you can't yet see, knowing it may never come.

## Closing

Napoleon III's mistake wasn't ambition. It was believing the feeling was enough.

Napoleon I had the feeling and the genius and the moment. The uncle got all three. The nephew got one, and assumed the others would follow.

Tukhachevsky had all three too. And the system destroyed him anyway.

I don't know what the lesson is.

Maybe all Bonapartism is delusion. Maybe the system just selects for people who feel like protagonists and discards the ones who don't fit. Maybe the whole idea of great men is an illusion, and history is just determinism wearing a mask. The Revolution would have found its general. The Soviet state would have found its modernizer. The feeling of agency is just the system's way of motivating the pieces it needs.

Maybe I'm just another nephew mistaking conviction for capacity.

I'm twenty, studying computer science. Next year I'll be doing quantitative research and building software products for hundreds of millions of users. On paper, this is success. I don't know if it's the right arena. I don't know if the feeling is telling the truth or lying. I don't know if I'm the Napoleon who in a strange timeline became a brilliant financier or engineer.

I find this very unsettling.
