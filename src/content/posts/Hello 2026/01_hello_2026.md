*A reflection on the year that changed everything, and what comes next.*

## The Year That Actually Happened

I entered 2025 scared. I'd missed the CS program cutoff by 3 points the year before, watched friends land internships I couldn't get, and spent most of first year feeling like I was falling behind. My GPA was a 3.0. I had three goals for second year: get back into CS, win some hackathons, land an internship. I wasn't confident about any of them.

By December 31, 2025:

**Academics**
- Made CS Post (out-of-stream, fewer than 50 spots)
- 100% in linear algebra
- 85-92% in data structures while the class average cratered
- GPA: 3.2 → 3.7+

**Career**
- 6 hackathon wins: UofTHacks, Hack the North, Google, NewHacks, AWS
- TreeHacks acceptance (Stanford's flagship, ~10% acceptance rate)
- Summer at Firefox Privacy Engineering
- RBC Capital Markets Quant Trading offer for Summer 2026

**Health**
- Completed a 70.3 Ironman
- Sprint triathlon
- Marathon coming in April
- 225km bike ride
- Found medication that actually works

**Leadership**
- VP Engineering at Blueprint (4 teams)
- Anthropic Campus Ambassador
- Director of Campus Strategy at UofT AI

I also reneged on an offer for the first time — left a corporate insurance gig after 2 months to take Firefox. Scary, but correct.

## What Changed

The obvious answer is "I worked harder." But that's not quite right. I've always worked hard in bursts. What changed was consistency and direction.

I stopped optimizing for appearing successful and started optimizing for actually learning. Attended lectures. Did problem sets early. Asked questions when confused instead of pretending I understood.

I also got serious about health. Not "I should probably exercise" serious — structured training serious. Triathlon gave me a forcing function: you can't fake a 70.3. You either put in the miles or you don't finish.

And I did more ERP (exposure and response prevention) for OCD than any year prior. The intrusive thoughts didn't disappear, but they lost their grip. More days felt good than bad for the first time in years.

## 2026: From Top 10% to Top 1%

2025 was escape velocity — going from behind to competitive. 2026 is about refinement. The goal is simple: become one of the best CS students at UofT.

What that means concretely:

**Winter 2026 (Jan - Apr)**

I'm taking CSC311 (ML), CSC373 (Algorithms), STA238 (Stats), and one of CSC384/343 — while working at Firefox. This is the hardest semester I've attempted. The plan:

- Study every evening after work, protect weekends
- Ship the privacy metrics widget by end of January
- Ship 2 more Firefox projects, including Rust and C++ patches
- 3.9+ term GPA

**Summer 2026 (May - Aug)**

RBC Quant starts. I'm also retaking MAT137 (got a C first year — unfinished business). Interview prep intensifies. Applications go out in July/August for Summer 2027.

Target companies: Citadel, Jane Street, Google, Apple. The goal is an S-tier internship.

**Fall 2026 (Sep - Dec)**

RBC continues. Research starts (lab TBD). Full Ironman race. Back to lifting focus post-race.

## The Real Challenge

The external goals are clear. The internal challenge is less obvious.

2025 worked because I had something to prove — to admissions committees, to professors who doubted my grades, to myself. That chip-on-shoulder energy is powerful but exhausting.

2026 needs to be different. I'm no longer behind. I'm no longer recovering. The question shifts from "can I catch up?" to "what am I building toward?"

I don't have a clean answer yet. But I know the direction: technical depth, meaningful work, and not burning out in the process.

## Specific Targets

Since I like accountability:

| Category | Target |
|----------|--------|
| GPA | 3.85+ cumulative by end of 2026 |
| Internship | S-tier offer for Summer 2027 |
| Fitness | Full Ironman, 185lbs at 14-15% bf |
| Research | Join a lab, ship something |
| Sleep | Average 7.5+ hours, Garmin score 80+ |

## One More Thing

I turned 20 this past September. Somehow that feels significant. Not because 20 is old, but because the excuses run out. "I'm still figuring things out" stops being a valid explanation for mediocrity.

I don't want to be the person with potential. I want to be the person who executed.

Here's to 2026.
