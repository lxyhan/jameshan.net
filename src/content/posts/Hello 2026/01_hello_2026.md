*A reflection on the year that changed everything, and what comes next.*

## 2025

First year didn't go the way I'd planned. I spent the summer before second year figuring out what needed to change.

By December 2025: 4.0 GPA, six hackathon wins, a 70.3 Ironman, and seven internship offers.

More than the outcomes, what changed was the process. I stopped optimizing for appearing successful and started actually learning. Attended lectures. Did problem sets early. Trained consistently instead of in bursts.

## 2026

This semester is the hardest I've attempted — four technical courses while interning. The goal is simple: keep the momentum going.

The broader aim is depth over breadth. I spent 2025 saying yes to everything. This year I want to go deeper on fewer things.

## One More Thing

I turned 20 this past September. Not old, but old enough that "still figuring things out" stops being a valid excuse.

I don't want to be the person with potential. I want to be the person who executed.

Here's to 2026.
